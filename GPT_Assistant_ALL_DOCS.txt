How Assistants work Beta

The Assistants API is designed to help developers build powerful AI assistants capable of performing a variety of tasks.

The Assistants API is in beta and we are actively working on adding more functionality. Share your feedback in our Developer Forum!
Assistants can call OpenAI’s models with specific instructions to tune their personality and capabilities.
Assistants can access multiple tools in parallel. These can be both OpenAI-hosted tools — like code_interpreter and file_search — or tools you build / host (via function calling).
Assistants can access persistent Threads. Threads simplify AI application development by storing message history and truncating it when the conversation gets too long for the model’s context length. You create a Thread once, and simply append Messages to it as your users reply.
Assistants can access files in several formats — either as part of their creation or as part of Threads between Assistants and users. When using tools, Assistants can also create files (e.g., images, spreadsheets, etc) and cite files they reference in the Messages they create.
Objects
Assistants object architecture diagram

OBJECT	WHAT IT REPRESENTS
Assistant	Purpose-built AI that uses OpenAI’s models and calls tools
Thread	A conversation session between an Assistant and a user. Threads store Messages and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a model’s context.
Message	A message created by an Assistant or a user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages stored as a list on the Thread.
Run	An invocation of an Assistant on a Thread. The Assistant uses its configuration and the Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the Assistant appends Messages to the Thread.
Run Step	A detailed list of steps the Assistant took as part of a Run. An Assistant can call tools or create Messages during its run. Examining Run Steps allows you to introspect how the Assistant is getting to its final results.
Creating Assistants
We recommend using OpenAI’s latest models with the Assistants API for best results and maximum compatibility with tools.

To get started, creating an Assistant only requires specifying the model to use. But you can further customize the behavior of the Assistant:

Use the instructions parameter to guide the personality of the Assistant and define its goals. Instructions are similar to system messages in the Chat Completions API.
Use the tools parameter to give the Assistant access to up to 128 tools. You can give it access to OpenAI-hosted tools like code_interpreter and file_search, or call a third-party tools via a function calling.
Use the tool_resources parameter to give the tools like code_interpreter and file_search access to files. Files are uploaded using the File upload endpoint and must have the purpose set to assistants to be used with this API.
For example, to create an Assistant that can create data visualization based on a .csv file, first upload a file.

python

python
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("revenue-forecast.csv", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)
Then, create the Assistant with the code_interpreter tool enabled and provide the file as a resource to the tool.

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  name="Data visualizer",
  description="You are great at creating beautiful data visualizations. You analyze data present in .csv files, understand trends, and come up with data visualizations relevant to those trends. You also share a brief text summary of the trends observed.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
  tool_resources={
    "code_interpreter": {
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  }
)
You can attach a maximum of 20 files to code_interpreter and 10,000 files to file_search (using vector_store objects).

Each file can be at most 512 MB in size and have a maximum of 5,000,000 tokens. By default, the size of all the files uploaded by your organization cannot exceed 100 GB, but you can reach out to our support team to increase this limit.

Managing Threads and Messages
Threads and Messages represent a conversation session between an Assistant and a user. There is no limit to the number of Messages you can store in a Thread. Once the size of the Messages exceeds the context window of the model, the Thread will attempt to smartly truncate messages, before fully dropping the ones it considers the least important.

You can create a Thread with an initial list of Messages like this:

python

python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create 3 data visualizations based on the trends in this file.",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "file_id": file.id,
          "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
Messages can contain text, images, or file attachment. Message attachments are helper methods that add files to a thread's tool_resources. You can also choose to add files to the thread.tool_resources directly.

Creating image input content
Message content can contain either external image URLs or File IDs uploaded via the File API. Only models with Vision support can accept image input. Supported image content types include png, jpg, gif, and webp. When creating image files, pass purpose="vision" to allow you to later download and display the input content. Currently, there is a 100GB limit per organization and 10GB for user in organization. Please contact us to request a limit increase.

Tools cannot access image content unless specified. To pass image files to Code Interpreter, add the file ID in the message attachments list to allow the tool to read and analyze the input. Image URLs cannot be downloaded in Code Interpreter today.

python

python
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("myimage.png", "rb"),
  purpose="vision"
)
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What is the difference between these images?"
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}
        },
        {
          "type": "image_file",
          "image_file": {"file_id": file.id}
        },
      ],
    }
  ]
)
Low or high fidelity image understanding
By controlling the detail parameter, which has three options, low, high, or auto, you have control over how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding.

low will enable the "low res" mode. The model will receive a low-res 512px x 512px version of the image, and represent the image with a budget of 85 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that do not require high detail.
high will enable "high res" mode, which first allows the model to see the low res image and then creates detailed crops of input images based on the input image size. Use the pricing calculator to see token counts for various image sizes.
python

python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What is this an image of?"
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://example.com/image.png",
            "detail": "high"
          }
        },
      ],
    }
  ]
)
Context window management
The Assistants API automatically manages the truncation to ensure it stays within the model's maximum context length. You can customize this behavior by specifying the maximum tokens you'd like a run to utilize and/or the maximum number of recent messages you'd like to include in a run.

Max Completion and Max Prompt Tokens
To control the token usage in a single Run, set max_prompt_tokens and max_completion_tokens when creating the Run. These limits apply to the total number of tokens used in all completions throughout the Run's lifecycle.

For example, initiating a Run with max_prompt_tokens set to 500 and max_completion_tokens set to 1000 means the first completion will truncate the thread to 500 tokens and cap the output at 1000 tokens. If only 200 prompt tokens and 300 completion tokens are used in the first completion, the second completion will have available limits of 300 prompt tokens and 700 completion tokens.

If a completion reaches the max_completion_tokens limit, the Run will terminate with a status of incomplete, and details will be provided in the incomplete_details field of the Run object.

When using the File Search tool, we recommend setting the max_prompt_tokens to no less than 20,000. For longer conversations or multiple interactions with File Search, consider increasing this limit to 50,000, or ideally, removing the max_prompt_tokens limits altogether to get the highest quality results.

Truncation Strategy
You may also specify a truncation strategy to control how your thread should be rendered into the model's context window. Using a truncation strategy of type auto will use OpenAI's default truncation strategy. Using a truncation strategy of type last_messages will allow you to specify the number of the most recent messages to include in the context window.

Message annotations
Messages created by Assistants may contain annotations within the content array of the object. Annotations provide information around how you should annotate the text in the Message.

There are two types of Annotations:

file_citation: File citations are created by the file_search tool and define references to a specific file that was uploaded and used by the Assistant to generate the response.
file_path: File path annotations are created by the code_interpreter tool and contain references to the files generated by the tool.
When annotations are present in the Message object, you'll see illegible model-generated substrings in the text that you should replace with the annotations. These strings may look something like 【13†source】 or sandbox:/mnt/data/file.csv. Here’s an example python code snippet that replaces these strings with information present in the annotations.

python

python
# Retrieve the message object
message = client.beta.threads.messages.retrieve(
  thread_id="...",
  message_id="..."
)
# Extract the message content
message_content = message.content[0].text
annotations = message_content.annotations
citations = []
# Iterate over the annotations and add footnotes
for index, annotation in enumerate(annotations):
    # Replace the text with a footnote
    message_content.value = message_content.value.replace(annotation.text, f' [{index}]')
    # Gather citations based on annotation attributes
    if (file_citation := getattr(annotation, 'file_citation', None)):
        cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_citation.file_id)
        citations.append(f'[{index}] {file_citation.quote} from {cited_file.filename}')
    elif (file_path := getattr(annotation, 'file_path', None)):
        cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_path.file_id)
        citations.append(f'[{index}] Click <here> to download {cited_file.filename}')
        # Note: File download functionality not implemented above for brevity
# Add footnotes to the end of the message before displaying to user
message_content.value += '\n' + '\n'.join(citations)
Runs and Run Steps
When you have all the context you need from your user in the Thread, you can run the Thread with an Assistant of your choice.

python

python
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  assistant_id=assistant.id
)
By default, a Run will use the model and tools configuration specified in Assistant object, but you can override most of these when creating the Run for added flexibility:

python

python
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  model="gpt-4o",
  instructions="New instructions that override the Assistant instructions",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}, {"type": "file_search"}]
)
Note: tool_resources associated with the Assistant cannot be overridden during Run creation. You must use the modify Assistant endpoint to do this.

Run lifecycle
Run objects can have multiple statuses.

Run lifecycle - diagram showing possible status transitions

STATUS	DEFINITION
queued	When Runs are first created or when you complete the required_action, they are moved to a queued status. They should almost immediately move to in_progress.
in_progress	While in_progress, the Assistant uses the model and tools to perform steps. You can view progress being made by the Run by examining the Run Steps.
completed	The Run successfully completed! You can now view all Messages the Assistant added to the Thread, and all the steps the Run took. You can also continue the conversation by adding more user Messages to the Thread and creating another Run.
requires_action	When using the Function calling tool, the Run will move to a required_action state once the model determines the names and arguments of the functions to be called. You must then run those functions and submit the outputs before the run proceeds. If the outputs are not provided before the expires_at timestamp passes (roughly 10 mins past creation), the run will move to an expired status.
expired	This happens when the function calling outputs were not submitted before expires_at and the run expires. Additionally, if the runs take too long to execute and go beyond the time stated in expires_at, our systems will expire the run.
cancelling	You can attempt to cancel an in_progress run using the Cancel Run endpoint. Once the attempt to cancel succeeds, status of the Run moves to cancelled. Cancellation is attempted but not guaranteed.
cancelled	Run was successfully cancelled.
failed	You can view the reason for the failure by looking at the last_error object in the Run. The timestamp for the failure will be recorded under failed_at.
incomplete	Run ended due to max_prompt_tokens or max_completion_tokens reached. You can view the specific reason by looking at the incomplete_details object in the Run.
Polling for updates
If you are not using streaming, in order to keep the status of your run up to date, you will have to periodically retrieve the Run object. You can check the status of the run each time you retrieve the object to determine what your application should do next.

You can optionally use Polling Helpers in our Node and Python SDKs to help you with this. These helpers will automatically poll the Run object for you and return the Run object when it's in a terminal state.

Thread locks
When a Run is in_progress and not in a terminal state, the Thread is locked. This means that:

New Messages cannot be added to the Thread.
New Runs cannot be created on the Thread.
Run steps
Run steps lifecycle - diagram showing possible status transitions

Run step statuses have the same meaning as Run statuses.

Most of the interesting detail in the Run Step object lives in the step_details field. There can be two types of step details:

message_creation: This Run Step is created when the Assistant creates a Message on the Thread.
tool_calls: This Run Step is created when the Assistant calls a tool. Details around this are covered in the relevant sections of the Tools guide.
Data access guidance
Currently, Assistants, Threads, Messages, and Vector Stores created via the API are scoped to the Project they're created in. As such, any person with API key access to that Project is able to read or write Assistants, Threads, Messages, and Runs in the Project.

We strongly recommend the following data access controls:

Implement authorization. Before performing reads or writes on Assistants, Threads, Messages, and Vector Stores, ensure that the end-user is authorized to do so. For example, store in your database the object IDs that the end-user has access to, and check it before fetching the object ID with the API.
Restrict API key access. Carefully consider who in your organization should have API keys and be part of a Project. Periodically audit this list. API keys enable a wide range of operations including reading and modifying sensitive information, such as Messages and Files.
Create separate accounts. Consider creating separate Projects for different applications in order to isolate data across multiple applications.
Next
Now that you have explored how Assistants work, the next step is to explore Assistant Tools which covers topics like Function calling, File Search, and Code Interpreter.

File Search Beta

File Search augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users. OpenAI automatically parses and chunks your documents, creates and stores the embeddings, and use both vector and keyword search to retrieve relevant content to answer user queries.

Quickstart
In this example, we’ll create an assistant that can help answer questions about companies’ financial statements.

Step 1: Create a new Assistant with File Search Enabled
Create a new assistant with file_search enabled in the tools parameter of the Assistant.

python

python
from openai import OpenAI
 
client = OpenAI()
 
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  name="Financial Analyst Assistant",
  instructions="You are an expert financial analyst. Use you knowledge base to answer questions about audited financial statements.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "file_search"}],
)
Once the file_search tool is enabled, the model decides when to retrieve content based on user messages.

Step 2: Upload files and add them to a Vector Store
To access your files, the file_search tool uses the Vector Store object. Upload your files and create a Vector Store to contain them. Once the Vector Store is created, you should poll its status until all files are out of the in_progress state to ensure that all content has finished processing. The SDK provides helpers to uploading and polling in one shot.

python

python
# Create a vector store caled "Financial Statements"
vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(name="Financial Statements")
 
# Ready the files for upload to OpenAI
file_paths = ["edgar/goog-10k.pdf", "edgar/brka-10k.txt"]
file_streams = [open(path, "rb") for path in file_paths]
 
# Use the upload and poll SDK helper to upload the files, add them to the vector store,
# and poll the status of the file batch for completion.
file_batch = client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll(
  vector_store_id=vector_store.id, files=file_streams
)
 
# You can print the status and the file counts of the batch to see the result of this operation.
print(file_batch.status)
print(file_batch.file_counts)
Step 3: Update the assistant to to use the new Vector Store
To make the files accessible to your assistant, update the assistant’s tool_resources with the new vector_store id.

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.update(
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  tool_resources={"file_search": {"vector_store_ids": [vector_store.id]}},
)
Step 4: Create a thread
You can also attach files as Message attachments on your thread. Doing so will create another vector_store associated with the thread, or, if there is already a vector store attached to this thread, attach the new files to the existing thread vector store. When you create a Run on this thread, the file search tool will query both the vector_store from your assistant and the vector_store on the thread.

In this example, the user attached a copy of Apple’s latest 10-K filing.

python

python
# Upload the user provided file to OpenAI
message_file = client.files.create(
  file=open("edgar/aapl-10k.pdf", "rb"), purpose="assistants"
)
 
# Create a thread and attach the file to the message
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How many shares of AAPL were outstanding at the end of of October 2023?",
      # Attach the new file to the message.
      "attachments": [
        { "file_id": message_file.id, "tools": [{"type": "file_search"}] }
      ],
    }
  ]
)
 
# The thread now has a vector store with that file in its tool resources.
print(thread.tool_resources.file_search)
Vector stores created using message attachements have a default expiration policy of 7 days after they were last active (defined as the last time the vector store was part of a run). This default exists to help you manage your vector storage costs. You can override these expiration policies at any time. Learn more here.

Step 5: Create a run and check the output
Now, create a Run and observe that the model uses the File Search tool to provide a response to the user’s question.

python

python
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler, OpenAI
 
client = OpenAI()
 
class EventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):
    @override
    def on_text_created(self, text) -> None:
        print(f"\nassistant > ", end="", flush=True)

    @override
    def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call):
        print(f"\nassistant > {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)

    @override
    def on_message_done(self, message) -> None:
        # print a citation to the file searched
        message_content = message.content[0].text
        annotations = message_content.annotations
        citations = []
        for index, annotation in enumerate(annotations):
            message_content.value = message_content.value.replace(
                annotation.text, f"[{index}]"
            )
            if file_citation := getattr(annotation, "file_citation", None):
                cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_citation.file_id)
                citations.append(f"[{index}] {cited_file.filename}")

        print(message_content.value)
        print("\n".join(citations))


# Then, we use the stream SDK helper
# with the EventHandler class to create the Run
# and stream the response.

with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    instructions="Please address the user as Jane Doe. The user has a premium account.",
    event_handler=EventHandler(),
) as stream:
    stream.until_done()
Your new assistant will query both attached vector stores (one containing goog-10k.pdf and brka-10k.txt, and the other containing aapl-10k.pdf) and return this result from aapl-10k.pdf.

How it works
The file_search tool implements several retrieval best practices out of the box to help you extract the right data from your files and augment the model’s responses. The file_search tool:

Rewrites user queries to optimize them for search.
Breaks down complex user queries into multiple searches it can run in parallel.
Runs both keyword and semantic searches across both assistant and thread vector stores.
Reranks search results to pick the most relevant ones before generating the final response.
By default, the file_search tool uses the following settings but these can be configured to suit your needs:

Chunk size: 800 tokens
Chunk overlap: 400 tokens
Embedding model: text-embedding-3-large at 256 dimensions
Maximum number of chunks added to context: 20 (could be fewer)
Known Limitations

We have a few known limitations we're working on adding support for in the coming months:

Support for deterministic pre-search filtering using custom metadata.
Support for parsing images within documents (including images of charts, graphs, tables etc.)
Support for retrievals over structured file formats (like csv or jsonl).
Better support for summarization — the tool today is optimized for search queries.
Vector stores
Vector Store objects give the File Search tool the ability to search your files. Adding a file to a vector_store automatically parses, chunks, embeds and stores the file in a vector database that's capable of both keyword and semantic search. Each vector_store can hold up to 10,000 files. Vector stores can be attached to both Assistants and Threads. Today, you can attach at most one vector store to an assistant and at most one vector store to a thread.

Creating vector stores and adding files
You can create a vector store and add files to it in a single API call:

python

python
vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(
  name="Product Documentation",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5']
)
Adding files to vector stores is an async operation. To ensure the operation is complete, we recommend that you use the 'create and poll' helpers in our official SDKs. If you're not using the SDKs, you can retrieve the vector_store object and monitor it's file_counts property to see the result of the file ingestion operation.

Files can also be added to a vector store after it's created by creating vector store files.

python

python
file = client.beta.vector_stores.files.create_and_poll(
  vector_store_id="vs_abc123",
  file_id="file-abc123"
)
Alternatively, you can add several files to a vector store by creating batches of up to 500 files.

python

python
batch = client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(
  vector_store_id="vs_abc123",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5']
)
Similarly, these files can be removed from a vector store by either:

Deleting the vector store file object or,
By deleting the underlying file object (which removes the file it from all vector_store and code_interpreter configurations across all assistants and threads in your organization)
The maximum file size is 512 MB. Each file should contain no more than 5,000,000 tokens per file (computed automatically when you attach a file).

File Search supports a variety of file formats including .pdf, .md, and .docx. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Attaching vector stores
You can attach vector stores to your Assistant or Thread using the tool_resources parameter.

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a helpful product support assistant and you answer questions based on the files provided to you.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "file_search"}],
  tool_resources={
    "file_search": {
      "vector_store_ids": ["vs_1"]
    }
  }
)

thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[ { "role": "user", "content": "How do I cancel my subscription?"} ],
  tool_resources={
    "file_search": {
      "vector_store_ids": ["vs_2"]
    }
  }
)
You can also attach a vector store to Threads or Assistants after they're created by updating them with the right tool_resources.

Ensuring vector store readiness before creating runs
We highly recommend that you ensure all files in a vector_store are fully processed before you create a run. This will ensure that all the data in your vector_store is searchable. You can check for vector_store readiness by using the polling helpers in our SDKs, or by manually polling the vector_store object to ensure the status is completed.

As a fallback, we've built a 60 second maximum wait in the Run object when the thread’s vector store contains files that are still being processed. This is to ensure that any files your users upload in a thread a fully searchable before the run proceeds. This fallback wait does not apply to the assistant's vector store.

Customizing File Search settings
You can customize how the file_search tool chunks your data and how many chunks it returns to the model context.

Chunking configuration

By default, max_chunk_size_tokens is set to 800 and chunk_overlap_tokens is set to 400, meaning every file is indexed by being split up into 800-token chunks, with 400-token overlap between consecutive chunks.

You can adjust this by setting chunking_strategy when adding files to the vector store. There are certain limitations to chunking_strategy:

max_chunk_size_tokens must be between 100 and 4096 inclusive.
chunk_overlap_tokens must be non-negative and should not exceed max_chunk_size_tokens / 2.
Number of chunks

By default, the file_search tool outputs up to 20 chunks for gpt-4* models and up to 5 chunks for gpt-3.5-turbo. You can adjust this by setting file_search.max_num_results in the tool when creating the assistant or the run.

Note that the file_search tool may output fewer than this number for a myriad of reasons:

The total number of chunks is fewer than max_num_results.
The total token size of all the retrieved chunks exceeds the token "budget" assigned to the file_search tool. The file_search tool currently has a token bugdet of:
4,000 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo
16,000 tokens for gpt-4* models
Managing costs with expiration policies
The file_search tool uses the vector_stores object as its resource and you will be billed based on the size of the vector_store objects created. The size of the vector store object is the sum of all the parsed chunks from your files and their corresponding embeddings.

You first GB is free and beyond that, usage is billed at $0.10/GB/day of vector storage. There are no other costs associated with vector store operations.

In order to help you manage the costs associated with these vector_store objects, we have added support for expiration policies in the vector_store object. You can set these policies when creating or updating the vector_store object.

python

python
vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create_and_poll(
  name="Product Documentation",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5'],
  expires_after={
	  "anchor": "last_active_at",
	  "days": 7
  }
)
Thread vector stores have default expiration policies

Vector stores created using thread helpers (like tool_resources.file_search.vector_stores in Threads or message.attachments in Messages) have a default expiration policy of 7 days after they were last active (defined as the last time the vector store was part of a run).

When a vector store expires, runs on that thread will fail. To fix this, you can simply recreate a new vector_store with the same files and reattach it to the thread.

python

python
all_files = list(client.beta.vector_stores.files.list("vs_expired"))

vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(name="rag-store")

Code Interpreter Beta

Code Interpreter allows Assistants to write and run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment. This tool can process files with diverse data and formatting, and generate files with data and images of graphs. Code Interpreter allows your Assistant to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems. When your Assistant writes code that fails to run, it can iterate on this code by attempting to run different code until the code execution succeeds.

See a quickstart of how to get started with Code Interpreter here.

How it works
Code Interpreter is charged at $0.03 per session. If your Assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads (e.g., one thread per end-user), two Code Interpreter sessions are created. Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that you only pay for one session per if users interact with Code Interpreter in the same thread for up to one hour.

Enabling Code Interpreter
Pass code_interpreter in the tools parameter of the Assistant object to enable Code Interpreter:

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
)
The model then decides when to invoke Code Interpreter in a Run based on the nature of the user request. This behavior can be promoted by prompting in the Assistant's instructions (e.g., “write code to solve this problem”).

Passing files to Code Interpreter
Files that are passed at the Assistant level are accessible by all Runs with this Assistant:

python

python
# Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("mydata.csv", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)

# Create an assistant using the file ID
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
  tool_resources={
    "code_interpreter": {
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  }
)
Files can also be passed at the Thread level. These files are only accessible in the specific Thread. Upload the File using the File upload endpoint and then pass the File ID as part of the Message creation request:

python

python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "file_id": file.id,
          "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
Files have a maximum size of 512 MB. Code Interpreter supports a variety of file formats including .csv, .pdf, .json and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Reading images and files generated by Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter in the API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. There are two types of files that are generated:

Images
Data files (e.g. a csv file with data generated by the Assistant)
When Code Interpreter generates an image, you can look up and download this file in the file_id field of the Assistant Message response:

{
	"id": "msg_abc123",
	"object": "thread.message",
	"created_at": 1698964262,
	"thread_id": "thread_abc123",
	"role": "assistant",
	"content": [
    {
      "type": "image_file",
      "image_file": {
        "file_id": "file-abc123"
      }
    }
  ]
  # ...
}
The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API:

python

python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

image_data = client.files.content("file-abc123")
image_data_bytes = image_data.read()

with open("./my-image.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(image_data_bytes)
When Code Interpreter references a file path (e.g., ”Download this csv file”), file paths are listed as annotations. You can convert these annotations into links to download the file:

{
  "id": "msg_abc123",
  "object": "thread.message",
  "created_at": 1699073585,
  "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "value": "The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:\n\n[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "type": "file_path",
            "text": "sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv",
            "start_index": 167,
            "end_index": 202,
            "file_path": {
              "file_id": "file-abc123"
            }
          }
          ...
Input and output logs of Code Interpreter
By listing the steps of a Run that called Code Interpreter, you can inspect the code input and outputs logs of Code Interpreter:

python

python
run_steps = client.beta.threads.runs.steps.list(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  run_id=run.id
)
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "step_abc123",
      "object": "thread.run.step",
      "type": "tool_calls",
      "run_id": "run_abc123",
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
      "status": "completed",

              "input": "# Calculating 2 + 2\nresult = 2 + 2\nresult",
              "outputs": [
                {
                  "type": "logs",
                  "logs": "4"
                }

Function calling Beta

Similar to the Chat Completions API, the Assistants API supports function calling. Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants API and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments.

Quickstart
In this example, we'll create a weather assistant and define two functions, get_current_temperature and get_rain_probability, as tools that the Assistant can call. Depending on the user query, the model will invoke parallel function calling if using our latest models released on or after Nov 6, 2023. In our example that uses parallel function calling, we will ask the Assistant what the weather in San Francisco is like today and the chances of rain. We also show how to output the Assistant’s response with streaming.

Step 1: Define functions
When creating your assistant, you will first define the functions under the tools param of the assistant.

python

python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
 
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a weather bot. Use the provided functions to answer questions.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_current_temperature",
        "description": "Get the current temperature for a specific location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA"
            },
            "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["Celsius", "Fahrenheit"],
              "description": "The temperature unit to use. Infer this from the user's location."
            }
          },
          "required": ["location", "unit"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_rain_probability",
        "description": "Get the probability of rain for a specific location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
)
Step 2: Create a Thread and add Messages
Create a Thread when a user starts a conversation and add Messages to the Thread as the user asks questions.

python

python
thread = client.beta.threads.create()
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  role="user",
  content="What's the weather in San Francisco today and the likelihood it'll rain?",
)
Step 3: Initiate a Run
When you initiate a Run on a Thread containing a user Message that triggers one or more functions, the Run will enter a pending status. After it processes, the run will enter a requires_action state which you can verify by checking the Run’s status. This indicates that you need to run tools and submit their outputs to the Assistant to continue Run execution. In our case, we will see two tool_calls, which indicates that the user query resulted in parallel function calling.

Note that a runs expire ten minutes after creation. Be sure to submit your tool outputs before the 10 min mark.

You will see two tool_calls within required_action, which indicates the user query triggered parallel function calling.

json

json
{
  "id": "run_qJL1kI9xxWlfE0z1yfL0fGg9",
  ...
  "status": "requires_action",
  "required_action": {
    "submit_tool_outputs": {
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_FthC9qRpsL5kBpwwyw6c7j4k",
          "function": {
            "arguments": "{"location": "San Francisco, CA"}",
            "name": "get_rain_probability"
          },
          "type": "function"
        },
        {
          "id": "call_RpEDoB8O0FTL9JoKTuCVFOyR",
          "function": {
            "arguments": "{"location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "Fahrenheit"}",
            "name": "get_current_temperature"
          },
          "type": "function"
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
    "type": "submit_tool_outputs"
  }
}
Run object truncated here for readability

How you initiate a Run and submit tool_calls will differ depending on whether you are using streaming or not, although in both cases all tool_calls need to be submitted at the same time. You can then complete the Run by submitting the tool outputs from the functions you called. Pass each tool_call_id referenced in the required_action object to match outputs to each function call.

For the streaming case, we create an EventHandler class to handle events in the response stream and submit all tool outputs at once with the “submit tool outputs stream” helper in the Python and Node SDKs.

python

python
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler
 
class EventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):
    @override
    def on_event(self, event):
      # Retrieve events that are denoted with 'requires_action'
      # since these will have our tool_calls
      if event.event == 'thread.run.requires_action':
        run_id = event.data.id  # Retrieve the run ID from the event data
        self.handle_requires_action(event.data, run_id)
 
    def handle_requires_action(self, data, run_id):
      tool_outputs = []
        
      for tool in data.required_action.submit_tool_outputs.tool_calls:
        if tool.function.name == "get_current_temperature":
          tool_outputs.append({"tool_call_id": tool.id, "output": "57"})
        elif tool.function.name == "get_rain_probability":
          tool_outputs.append({"tool_call_id": tool.id, "output": "0.06"})
        
      # Submit all tool_outputs at the same time
      self.submit_tool_outputs(tool_outputs, run_id)
 
    def submit_tool_outputs(self, tool_outputs, run_id):
      # Use the submit_tool_outputs_stream helper
      with client.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs_stream(
        thread_id=self.current_run.thread_id,
        run_id=self.current_run.id,
        tool_outputs=tool_outputs,
        event_handler=EventHandler(),
      ) as stream:
        for text in stream.text_deltas:
          print(text, end="", flush=True)
        print()
 
 
with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  event_handler=EventHandler()
) as stream:
  stream.until_done()
What's new in v2? Beta

April 2024
We are announcing a variety of new features and improvements to the Assistants API and moving our Beta to a new API version, OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2. Here's what's new:

We're launching an improved retrieval tool called file_search, which can ingest up to 10,000 files per assistant - 500x more than before. It is faster, supports parallel queries through multi-threaded searches, and features enhanced reranking and query rewriting.
Alongside file_search, we're introducing vector_store objects in the API. Once a file is added to a vector store, it's automatically parsed, chunked, and embedded, made ready to be searched. Vector stores can be used across assistants and threads, simplifying file management and billing.
You can now control the maximum number of tokens a run uses in the Assistants API, allowing you to manage token usage costs. You can also set limits on the number of previous / recent messages used in each run.
We've added support for the tool_choice parameter which can be used to force the use of a specific tool (like file_search, code_interpreter, or a function) in a particular run.
You can now create messages with the role assistant to create custom conversation histories in Threads.
Assistant and Run objects now support popular model configuration parameters like temperature, response_format (JSON mode), and top_p.
You can now use fine-tuned models in the Assistants API. At the moment, only fine-tuned versions of gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 are supported.
Assistants API now supports streaming.
We've added several streaming and polling helpers to our Node and Python SDKs.
See our migration guide to learn more about how to migrate your tool usage to the latest version of the Assistants API.
AssistantsBeta
Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

Get started with the Assistants API

Create assistantBeta
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants
Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

Request body
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.

name
string or null

Optional
The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description
string or null

Optional
The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter, file_search, or function.


Show possible types
tool_resources
object or null

Optional
A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.


Show properties
metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
Returns
An assistant object.

https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}
Modifies an assistant.

Path parameters
assistant_id
string

Required
The ID of the assistant to modify.

Request body
model
Optional
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.

name
string or null

Optional
The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description
string or null

Optional
The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter, file_search, or function.


Show possible types
tool_resources
object or null

Optional
A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.


Show properties
metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Returns
The modified assistant object.

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Create thread and runBeta
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/runs
Create a thread and run it in one request.

Request body
assistant_id
string

Required
The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run.

thread
object

Optional

Show properties
model
string

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

tools
array or null

Optional
Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

tool_resources
object or null

Optional
A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.


Show properties
metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
If true, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a data: [DONE] message.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

truncation_strategy
object

Optional
Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.

The nucleus sampling value used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

truncation_strategy
object

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

response_format
string or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

StreamingBeta
Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs.

You can stream events from the Create Thread and Run, Create Run, and Submit Tool Outputs endpoints by passing "stream": true. The response will be a Server-Sent events stream.

Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the Assistants API quickstart to learn more.

The message delta objectBeta
Represents a message delta i.e. any changed fields on a message during streaming.

id
string

The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object
string

The object type, which is always thread.message.delta.

delta
object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.


Show properties
The message delta object
{
  "id": "msg_123",
  "object": "thread.message.delta",
  "delta": {
    "content": [

        "index": 0,
        "type": "text",
        "text": { "value": "Hello", "annotations": [] }
      }
    ]
  }
}
The run step delta objectBeta
Represents a run step delta i.e. any changed fields on a run step during streaming.

id
string

The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object
string

The object type, which is always thread.run.step.delta.

delta
object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the run step.


Show properties
The run step delta object
{
  "id": "step_123",
  "object": "thread.run.step.delta",
  "delta": {
    "step_details": {
      "type": "tool_calls",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "index": 0,

          "type": "code_interpreter",
          "code_interpreter": { "input": "", "outputs": [] }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
Assistant stream eventsBeta
Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an event and data property:

event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit thread.run.created when a new run is created, thread.run.completed when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a thread.message.created event, a thread.message.in_progress event, many thread.message.delta events, and finally a thread.message.completed event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the Assistants API quickstart to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.
